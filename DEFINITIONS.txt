webpack     is an open-source JavaScript module bundler.

            It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if
            the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets
            representing those modules.

            Webpack takes the dependencies and generates a dependency graph allowing web developers to use a modular
            approach for their web application development purposes. It can be used from the command line, or can be
            configured using a configuration file which is named webpack.config.js. This file is used to define rules,
            plugins, etc., for a project. (webpack is highly extensible via rules which allow developers to write custom
            tasks that they want to perform when bundling files together.)

            Node.js is required for using webpack.

            provides code on demand using the moniker code splitting. The Technical Committee 39 for ECMAScript is
            working on standardization of a function that loads additional code: "proposal-dynamic-import".
