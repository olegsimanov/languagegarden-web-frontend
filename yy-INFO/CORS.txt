Functional overview

The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard works by adding new HTTP headers that let servers describe which origins
are permitted to read that information from a web browser. Additionally, for HTTP request methods that can cause
side-effects on server data (in particular, HTTP methods other than GET, or POST with certain MIME types), the
specification mandates that browsers "preflight" the request, soliciting supported methods from the server with the
HTTP OPTIONS request method, and then, upon "approval" from the server, sending the actual request. Servers can also
inform clients whether "credentials" (such as Cookies and HTTP Authentication) should be sent with requests.

CORS failures result in errors, but for security reasons, specifics about the error are not available to JavaScript.
All the code knows is that an error occurred. The only way to determine what specifically went wrong is to look at
the browser's console for details.

Subsequent sections discuss scenarios, as well as provide a breakdown of the HTTP headers used.
