python is used only to setup virtual environment
its handy to use virtual environment because all the installation files are stored in one folder and are not
spread across the system. You can have as many virtual environments as you want

    requirements.txt            binaries from here are used to build the project (bower and webpack)

./components/

    app                         source code of the editor and the player
    web_modules                 custom libraries used by the source code
    bower.json                  libraries used by the source code are listed here
    bower_components            after you run `bower install bower.json` this folder is generated
                                contains library files used by the source code

    webpack.config.js           defines how to build and assemble the project
    webpack-instance-config.js  was used by the python IAAS configuration framework (should be merged with previous file later)
    package.json                dependencies used by webpack are defined here

    node_modules                after you run `npm install package.json` this folder is generated

    build                       this is the output of the `webpack` command

./scripts/setup

    install.sh                  call this from a virtual environment to install all the necessary dependencies
                                to build the project

    ...                         other scripts are used by install.sh

./staticpages-demo

    nginx                       nginx configuration files

      nginx/start-nginx.sh      simple run script to serve static, editor.html and player.html pages

    static                      a symlink to the ./components/build folder (listed above)
    editor.html                 example how to embed language garden editor in an html page
